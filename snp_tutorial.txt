Calling SNPs with Samtools
==========================

In this tutorial, we're going to use the sorted BAM files we generated
earlier to generate a list of SNPs at which the iso-female lines we
re-sequenced differ from the reference Drosophila melanogaster
genome. We'll be using Samtools for this, but there is other software
out there that will call SNPs and genotypes for you. We encourage you
to try them out on your own.

Getting the data
----------------

Set up your EC2 server, and mount the provided snapshot
(snap-000d346e) on /data.

Next, install Samtools. When you are installing Samtools, make sure to
install bcftools as well (which is included as part of the Samtools
package)::

  cd /mnt
  curl -O -L http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/0.1.18/samtools-0.1.18.tar.bz2
  tar xvfj samtools-0.1.18.tar.bz2
  cd samtools-0.1.18
  make
  cp samtools /usr/local/bin
  cd misc/
  cp *.pl maq2sam-long maq2sam-short md5fa md5sum-lite wgsim /usr/local/bin/
  cd ..
  cd bcftools
  cp *.pl bcftools /usr/local/bin/

Since it took a while to do map our reads to the reference genome last
time, we have the sorted bam files saved in the /data/snp_calling/
folder.

We're going to try out two separate SNP callers, so let's try to keep
ourselves organized::

  mkdir samtools_snps
  cd samtools_snps

Calling SNPs with Samtools
--------------------------

To generate a BCF file (which is a binary data format used to hold information about sequence variants such as SNPs), run the following lines::

  samtools mpileup -uD -r 2L:100,000-150,000 -f /data/drosophila/dmel-all-chromosome-r5.37.fasta \
  /data/snp_calling/RAL357_full_bwa.sorted.bam /data/snp_calling/RAL391_full_bwa.sorted.bam | \
  bcftools view -bvcg - > RAL_samtools.raw.bcf

You'll notice that this command has two parts, and we've used several flags in the first part of it. Here's what they mean::

  -u tells it to output into an uncompressed bcf file (rather than compressed)
  -D tells it to keep read depth for each sample
  -r tells it which chromosome region to call SNPs for (you can omit this if you want to do the whole genome, but in the interest of speed, we picked a 50kb region)
  -f tells it that the next argument is going to be the reference genome file

The Samtools portion of this calculates our genotype likelihoods. We
then pipe the output to bcftools, which does our SNP calling based on
those likelihoods. This portion of the command has several options as
well. The -b flag tells it to output to BCF format (rather than VCF);
-c tells it to do SNP calling, and -v tells it to only output
potential variant sites (i.e., exclude monomorphic ones); and -g tells
it to call genotypes for each sample in addition to just calling
SNPs. Then we run::

  bcftools view RAL_samtools.raw.bcf | vcfutils.pl varFilter -D100
     > RAL_samtools.vcf

This line converts the BCF file into a VCF file (a flat text file
rather than a binary, making it a lot easier to view), and then we
pipe that into vcfutils.pl with the varFilter -D100 option, which
filters out SNPs that had read depth higher than 100 (we don't want to
trust SNPs at sites with super high coverage, because they might be
represent variation between variable copy number repeats, i.e., the
reads that map to this location in the reference are actually from
duplicated sites in your sample; you can--and should--change this
parameter based on the kind of coverage you have in your dataset,
e.g., -D500).

How does samtools detect SNPs? Every time a mapped read shows a
mis-match from the reference genome, it does some fancy statistics to
try and figure out whether the mis-match is because of a real SNP. It
incorporates different types of information, such as the number of
different reads that share a mis-match from the reference, the
sequence quality data, and the expected sequencing error rates, and it
essentially figures out whether it's more likely that the observed
mis-match is due simply to a sequencing error, or because of a true
SNP.

The resulting VCF file has a lot of information about your
genotypes. For a detailed description of the VCF format, see
http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/specs.html.

Fow now, let's look at the first few lines of the VCF file. The file
lists the chromosome, position, ID, reference allele at that
nucleotide position, and alternate alleles detected in our dataset
(across all samples). It also tells you the "Quality" -- which is
basically a measure of how confident Samtools is that there really is
a SNP there (higher is better) -- and whether or not that SNP passed
the quality filters. The "Info" field tells you various statistics
about each position; the information in this field can vary, but what
exactly each symbol (e.g., NS, DP, etc.) should be explained in the
file header. The "Format" field tells you what type of data are found
in the rest of the fields (there should be one additional field for
each sample that you ran through Samtools). For example, GT:GQ:DP
means that the sample fields for this position tell you the genotype,
genotype quality, and depth (coverage) of each sample that you fed
into Samtools; again, explanations of these symbol names (GT, GT, DP)
can be found in the header of your VCF file.::

Calling SNPs with GATK's Unified Genotyper
------------------------------------------
 
Now let's try mapping our reads with another mapper, the Unified
Genotyper included as part of the Genome Analysis Toolkit
(GATK). Again, let's try to keep our files organized::

  cd /mnt
  mkdir GATK_snps

Download GATK
-------------

The latest version of GATK require headers in SAM file, which are missing in
the sample datasets. Therefore, we will download older version to use in this
tutorial. You should download the latest version for you analysis.::

  cd /mnt/
  curl -O ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/gsa/GenomeAnalysisTK/GenomeAnalysisTK-1.0.5974.tar.bz2
  tar xvfj GenomeAnalysisTK-latest.tar.bz2


Like FastQC, this is also written in java, so let's make sure java is installed::

  java -version
  
Now let's run GATK's Unified Genotyper. The GATK people recommend a
few quality control steps before you run the SNP calling. In
particular, they recommend local re-alignment around indels, because
reads whose ends map to the location of an indel can sometimes lead to
false positive SNP calls. I'll try to illustrate this with a
simplified example. Suppose the reference sequence is GGGGTTTT and
there's an alternate allele with a 4-bp insertion of C's:
GGGGCCCCTTTT. Now if a read carries the entire insertion, the aligner
can figure things out without a problem. However, if the end of the
read overlaps the insertion, you could run into problems. For
example::

  Reference : GGGG----TTTT
  Read 1    :    GCCCCT
  Read 2    : GGGG----C
                      *
  
Read 1 looks fine, but read 2 is probably mis-aligned; rather than
counting the C as an insertion, which is probably better, the aligner
has placed it after the indel, making it look like there is a SNP
there. In GATK we can account for this problem by doing local
re-alignment around potential indel sites, in which we incorporate
information about all the reads in that region simultaneously, rather
than mapping each read individually. First, GATK needs to figure out
which regions are in need of re-alignment::

    cd /mnt/GATK_snps

    java -Xmx1g -jar /mnt/GenomeAnalysisTK-1.0.5974/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T RealignerTargetCreator -R /data/drosophila/dmel-all-chromosome-r5.37.fasta -I /data/snp_calling/RAL357_full_bwa.sorted.bam -o RAL357.realign.intervals -L 2L:100000-150000
  
And then it needs to actually do the re-alignment (this step is slow,
taking ~10 min, even for our small region)::

    java -Xmx4g -jar /mnt/GenomeAnalysisTK-1.0.5974/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -I /data/snp_calling/RAL357_full_bwa.sorted.bam -R /data/drosophila/dmel-all-chromosome-r5.37.fasta -T IndelRealigner -targetIntervals RAL357.realign.intervals -o RAL357_full_bwa.realigned.bam

Now we need to do this re-alignment again with the other fly strain
that we genotyped (if you were running a large number of samples, this
is where a shell script would come in handy). You might want to run
this in the background or in a new session while you're re-aligning
the first one::

    java -Xmx1g -jar /mnt/GenomeAnalysisTK-1.0.5974/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T RealignerTargetCreator -R /data/drosophila/dmel-all-chromosome-r5.37.fasta -I /data/snp_calling/RAL391_full_bwa.sorted.bam -o RAL391.realign.intervals -L 2L:100000-150000

    java -Xmx4g -jar /mnt/GenomeAnalysisTK-1.0.5974/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -I /data/snp_calling/RAL391_full_bwa.sorted.bam -R /data/drosophila/dmel-all-chromosome-r5.37.fasta -T IndelRealigner -targetIntervals RAL391.realign.intervals -o RAL391_full_bwa.realigned.bam
  
Now we would like to run the SNP caller, but we first need to use a
package called Picard to fix a minor formatting problem in the
re-aligned BAM files before GATK's Unified Genotyper will accept them
(these steps take a few minutes each as well)::

      cd /mnt
      curl -O -L http://sourceforge.net/projects/picard/files/picard-tools/1.47/picard-tools-1.47.zip
      unzip picard-tools-1.47.zip
      cd /mnt/GATK_snps/
      java -jar /mnt/picard-tools-1.47/AddOrReplaceReadGroups.jar I= RAL357_full_bwa.realigned.bam O= RAL357_full_bwa.realigned.fixed.bam SORT_ORDER=coordinate RGID=RAL357 RGLB=RAL357 RGPL=illumina RGPU=RAL357 RGSM=RAL357 CREATE_INDEX=True VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT 
      java -jar /mnt/picard-tools-1.47/AddOrReplaceReadGroups.jar I= RAL391_full_bwa.realigned.bam O= RAL391_full_bwa.realigned.fixed.bam SORT_ORDER=coordinate RGID=RAL391 RGLB=RAL391 RGPL=illumina RGPU=RAL391 RGSM=RAL391 CREATE_INDEX=True VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT 
  
And finally we can run GATK's SNP caller::  

    java -jar /mnt/GenomeAnalysisTK-1.0.5974/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -R /data/drosophila/dmel-all-chromosome-r5.37.fasta -T UnifiedGenotyper -I RAL357_full_bwa.realigned.fixed.bam -I RAL391_full_bwa.realigned.fixed.bam -o RAL_GATK.vcf -stand_call_conf 50.0 -stand_emit_conf 10.0 -dcov 500 -L  2L:100000-150000

These parameqters are similar, but not identical, to those in Samtools. -stand_emit_conf 10.0 means that it won't report any potential SNPs with a quality below 10.0; but unless they meet the quality threshold set by -stand_call_conf (50.0, in this case), they will be listed as failing the quality filter. -dcov 500 means that any site that has more than 500x coverage, the genotype caller will only use 500 randomly selected reads (for computational efficiency).

Keep in mind that, at this point, indel calling in GATK's Unified
Genotyper does not seem to be well supported. For that, you may want
to stick with Samtools or other software for now.

Another approach you could take is to just do the local re-alignment
with GATK, but then do your SNP calling using Samtools on the locally
re-aligned BAM files.::

      samtools mpileup -uD -r 2L:100,000-150,000 -f /data/drosophila/dmel-all-chromosome-r5.37.fasta RAL357_full_bwa.realigned.fixed.bam RAL391_full_bwa.realigned.fixed.bam | bcftools view -bvcg - > RAL_samtools_fixed.raw.bcf
      bcftools view RAL_samtools_fixed.raw.bcf | vcfutils.pl varFilter -D100 > RAL_samtools_fixed.vcf

Comparing output
----------------

Now say you want to count how many SNPs each SNP calling approach
found. You could do this pretty simply using grep on the vcf file. In
this case, we only looked at a region on chromosome 2L, and the
chromosome is the first thing listed about each SNP. So we can search
for and then count every line in the vcf file that begins with the
text '2L'. To use grep to search for text at the beginning of a line,
you use the ^ symbol. Once we find the lines in the vcf file that
describe our SNPs, we're going to pipe them all to the wc command
(with the -l flag) to count how many of them there are::

  cd /mnt
  grep '^2L' samtools_snps/RAL_samtools.vcf | wc -l
  grep '^2L' GATK_snps/RAL_GATK.vcf | wc -l
  grep '^2L' GATK_snps/RAL_samtools_fixed.vcf | wc -l
  
Which approach detected the most SNPs in this region?

There is a package called vcftools that has all sorts of utilities for
working with VCF files. I won't go over it here, but consult the
project's website and documentation at
http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/ if you are interested. For now,
compare the SNPs that each SNP caller detected by viewing the VCF
files using less::

  less samtools_snps/RAL_samtools.vcf
  less GATK_snps/RAL_GATK.vcf
  less GATK_snps/RAL_samtools_fixed.vcf
  
Another exercise:

In the snp_calling directory, you will also find BAM files generated
by aligning the same set of reads to the same reference genome for one
of the two fly lines (RAL357) using bowtie rather than bwa. Use
Samtools to call SNPs and generate a VCF file on the bowtie alignment
and compare it to the VCF file you got from the bwa alignment.
