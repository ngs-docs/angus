# For instructors!

## [Tutorial authoring guide](authoring-guide.html)

Information on how to update the tutorials on the Web site, where to put files, etc.

## E-mail lists

We have lots of e-mail lists!  But they're all based on one master list.

Briefly, the lists below go to:

* [dibsi18@groups.io](mailto:dibsi18@groups.io) - EVERYONE
* [helpers@dibsi18.groups.io](mailto:helpers@dibsi18.groups.io) - All the instructors, helpers, and other friendly folk who just want things to work, gosh darn it.

Karen and Titus are on all of these lists. Yay!
