Instructor's Guide to ANGUS Materials
=====================================

The main repository is here: https://github.com/ngs-docs/angus.
Please try to keep everything in there as much as possible.

For 2014, contribute to the branch '2014'.

We use `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`__ to build the site from
multiple files, and each file is written in `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__.

Merges to the '2014' branch are automatically built and posted by
readthedocs.org at http://angus.readthedocs.org/en/2014/

You can use pull requests OR you can just send Titus your github ID
and he will give you merge privileges.  For the first few modifications
we would still suggest using pull requests just so you can get the
hang of reST.

Put static files that you do not want interpreted by Sphinx
(e.g. presentation PDFs) in the ``files/`` directory.

Licensing
~~~~~~~~~

Everything you do must be releasable under CC0 except for your
presentation slides, which must be accessible and posted somewhere
reasonably permanent (in our repo, on slideshare, etc) but can be
under whatever license you choose.
