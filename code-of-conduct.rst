Workshop Code of Conduct
========================

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our workshop
are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers
will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting
cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment
for everybody.

**tl; dr: Don't be a jerk.**

Need Help?

You can reach the course director, Titus Brown, at titus@idyll.org or

to any of the instructors or TAs if you need immediate help.

Judi Brown Clarke, jbc@msu.edu, is the person to contact if Titus is not
available or there are larger problems; she is available via phone at

The Quick Version
-----------------

Our workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free workshop
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of workshop
participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
appropriate for any workshop venue, including talks, workshops,
parties, Twitter and other online media. Workshop participants
violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the workshop
*without a refund* at the discretion of the workshop
organisers.

The Less Quick Version
----------------------

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the workshop
organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please contact a member of workshop
staff immediately.

Workshop instructors and TAs will be happy to help participants
contact KBS security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or
otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
duration of the workshop. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at workshop and workshop
venues and workshop-related social events.
