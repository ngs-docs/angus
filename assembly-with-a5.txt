Assembling microbial genomes with A5
====================================

Let's try using a different assembly pipeline -- the A5 pipeline, from
`An Integrated Pipeline for de Novo Assembly of Microbial Genomes
<http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0042304>`__.

First, let's install it.  You can go to the `ngopt project
<http://code.google.com/p/ngopt/>`__ to see the info necessary; we're
going to grab the Linux/64-bit version, which corresponds to our Amazon
instance. ::

   cd /root
   curl -O http://ngopt.googlecode.com/files/ngopt_a5pipeline_linux-x64_20120518.tar.gz
   tar xzf ngopt_a5pipeline_linux-x64_20120518.tar.gz
   mv ngopt_a5pipeline_linux-x64_20120518 ngopt

These commands download it, unpack it, and rename it to 'ngopt'.

Now, go to your working space, and create a new directory -- ::

   cd /mnt
   mkdir a5
   cd a5

'a5' has its own preprocessing steps and everything; if you trust them, you can
just run a5 directly::

   /root/ngopt/bin/a5_pipeline.pl ../ecoli_ref-5m.fastq.gz ecoli
