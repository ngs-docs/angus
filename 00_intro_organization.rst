Getting your project started
============================

Project organization is one of the most important parts of a sequencing
project, but is often overlooked in the excitment to get a first look at
new data. While it's best to get yourself organized before you begin
analysis, it's never too late to start.

You should approach your sequencing project in a very similar way to how
you do a biological experiment, and ideally, begins with experimental
design. We're going to assume that you've already designed a beautiful
sequencing experiment to address your biological question, collected
appropriate samples, and that you have enough statistical power. For all
of those steps, collecting specimens, extracting DNA, prepping your
samples, you've likely kept a lab notebook that details how and why you
did each step, but documentation doesn't stop at the sequencer!

Every computational analysis you do is going to spawn many files, and
inevitability, you'll want to run some of those analysis again. Genomics
projects can quickly accumulates hundreds of files across tens of
folders. Do you remember what PCR conditions you used to create your
sequencing library? Probably not. Similarly, you probably won't remember
whether your best alignment results were in Analysis1, AnalysisRedone,
or AnalysisRedone2; or which quality cutoff you used.

Luckily, recording your computational experiments is even easier than
recording lab data. Copy/Paste will become your best friend, sensible
file names will make your analysis traversable by you and your
collaborators, and writing the methods section for your next paper will
be a breeze. Let's look at the best practices for documenting your
genomics project.

Your future self will thank you.
