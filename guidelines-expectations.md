# Guidelines & Expectations for ANGUS 2019 Events

 ## Introduction
Everyone who participates in our ANGUS 2019 workshop shares the responsibility of creating a welcoming environment for learning and networking. As such, we would like to outline **Workshop Guidelines** for everyone and **expectations** for people based on their participation role below. 

 **Note:** *All DIBSI participants must follow the event [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.html).* Our first priority is to provide and sustain a safe and welcoming environment for learning and teaching!  

 ## Workshop Guidelines 
1. **Our primary commitment is to learn from each other.** We will listen to each other and not talk at each other. We acknowledge differences amongst us in backgrounds, skills, interests, and values. We realize that it is these very differences that will increase our awareness and understanding through this process.

 2. **Share responsibility for including everyone in the discussion.** Be mindful of taking up much more space than others. Empower yourself to speak up when others are dominating the conversation.

 3. **Confidentiality.** We want to create an atmosphere for open, honest exchange. Unless it is an actionable item or specifically indicated on notecards, we will not share beyond this room without permission.

 4. **Do not demean, devalue, or "put down" people** for their experiences, lack of experiences, difference in interpretation of those experiences, or choice of computer or software.

 5. **Expect a range of emotions to be present, though not always visible.** The workshop has long days and can be very intense for those around us.

 6. **Trust that people are always doing the best they can.** We will give each other the benefit of the doubt. We will assume we are all trying our hardest and that our intentions are good even when the impact is not. **Consider being wrong** and accept responsibility for the consequences of our actions, regardless of their intentions. 

 7. **Challenge the idea and not the person and expect to have your perspectives challenged by others.** If we wish to challenge something that has been said, we will challenge the idea or the practice referred to, not the individual sharing this idea or practice. 

 8. **Speak your discomfort.** If something is bothering you, please share this with the group, your helper/instructor/coordinators, or submit a response through our online form. Often our emotional reactions to this process offer the most valuable learning opportunities.

 9. **Expect and accept a lack of closure.** We will cover a myriad of topics throughout this workshop and not all questions will be answered or clear. 

 10. **We are all a work in progress.** We will not assume that one comment or one opinion made at one time captures the whole of a person's character. We are all in the process of learning, including the facilitators.
